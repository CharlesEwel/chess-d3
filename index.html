<h1>Charlie's Chess Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to my chess page. I recently started playing chess semi-competitvely, and have been really interested in trying to examine openings from a more analytical perspective. In chess, there are different ways of opening the game that determine what kind of feel the rest of the game will have. Players spend a lot of time studying the opening and trying to build a repertoire of opening moves that will give them an advantage going into the midgame. More has been written about the opening then any other phase of the game, and lots of highly theoretical work has gone into trying to find the 'best' opening.</p>
<p>One issue many players at the amateur level run into, is that the top tier openings require a large amount of study, in order to keep up with the latest theory. It is not uncommon, at the grandmaster level, for games in the open sicilian or ruy lopez to see 20-30 moves played effectively from a script before the 'over the board' thinking commences. For people who are not professional players and cannot devote massive amounts of time to chess, it is desirable to try and examine more obscure openings in the hope of bypassing much of that study, and, as an added bonus, potentially catching one's opponent in an unfamiliar position.</p>
<p>There is a trade-off however, the common wisdom is that most of the truly obscure openings are infrequently played for a reason, that reason being that they are not very strong. As such, one has to weigh the benefit of picking an opening less frequently played against the negative of playing less theoretically sound moves. This project began as an attempt to do exactly that, to try and quantify and visualize this tradeoff of quality for quantity, and identify the most 'underplayed' openings in chess</p>
<h2>First Attempts</h2>
<p>One thing I've noticed in my own chess career, mostly over the internet, is that this practice of trying to bypass theory was so common that many allegedly obscure opening systems were actually more common then the main lines. At the time I was trying to play the hyper-accelerated dragon variation of the Sicilian Defense as black when my opponent played e4 as their first move. This opening is played when white attempts to enter the open sicilian, and other systems are required when white plays various anti-sicilian sidelines. The book I had purchased to study focused mainly on the open sicilian, and assured me that this would be the most common attack I'd face. It spent relatively less time on what it termed 'side-lines', which were what my opponents typically ended up playing. This book was written by grandmasters, and their assessment of the frequency with which I'd face each of these openings was probably true at the grandmaster level. But at the club level I felt unprepared for what I was actually playing</p>
<p>Anyway, the point being that for this project I wanted to get data on how popular various opening are at lower rating levels than were typically examined in mainstream chess publications. I found data for that at chesstempo.com and began transcribing that into a spreadsheet that I could use for my data visualization. Sadly, their database does not support any 'Export to CSV' functionality, so I had to do a decent amount of data entry by hand. For my first attempt I decided to consider someone who was building a repertoire for playing as the white pieces and wanted to open with 1 e4, which in chess is known as a king's pawn opening. I decided to look at the first three moves, and to only include openings for which a minimum of 100 games had been played at the elo range I was looking at. That sample size was picked because I wanted the winning percentages to be relatively uninfluenced by game-to-game variation, and the other contraints were chosen to keep the manual data entry minimal and keep the scope of the first attempt relatively small</p>
